# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
The impact of weather and bicycle traffic on bicycle theft in Berlin

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
Does sunny or rainy weather have an impact on bicycle theft in Berlin? Is there a correlation between temperature or percipitation and bicycle theft (or a seasonality)? 

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Bicycle theft is a huge problem in Berlin, as it has one of [the highest rates of bike theft per inhabitant in Germany](https://www.wsm.eu/en/knowledge/bicycle-theft-in-germany/). This poses the question: How can i keep my bicycle safe in Berlin? Apart from a strong lock, there might be other influences on the probability of getting your bike stolen, such as place or time of the day. A rather uncommon factor to think of is the weather, though it plays a huge part in mobility and transportation, especially for bicycles. Thus, in this project, i will analyze correlations between bicycle theft, bicycle counts and weather data by combining three datasets from Berlin.
